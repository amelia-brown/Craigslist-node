There is no bike storage here, either...sorry!<br>\nNot suitable for work-at-home arrangements<br>\n<br>\nRent is $1250 per month, plus utilities, which run on average $65 per person and include wireless internet, PG&amp;E, garbage and water.<br>\n<br>\nFirst and last month&apos;s rent + $1000 deposit to move in.

We are currently looking for help with rent in the form of a respectful, sweet, super clean, community- and household- oriented people as we search for the perfect long-term situation**.<br>\n<br>\nD, 34, has been living here since she moved to SF about 8 years ago, works as a nanny and at a yoga studio, and is expecting a baby in October! Her partner E, 31,  just moved in to the flat but has lived in SF his whole life, works full time and keeps busy with yoga and martial arts. We&apos;re planning a home birth and are busy preparing our home and lives for the arrival our lovechild. We also spend time cooking at home and tending our community garden plot.<br>\n<br>\nIn the short term, we are looking for temporary tenants that will meet the following expectations:<br>\n<br>\nUnderstand that this is a temporary sublet. We are currently looking for someone to join the house for only one month in September*. If it turns out to be an extremely good fit, we may invite you to stay on for a longer term. <br>\n<br>\n*There is a very slight possibility that our home birth would happen in the last week of September, and at that time we would need optimal privacy in order to let a natural birth work. We would graciously ask you to stay out for 1-3 days. In this unlikely case, we would both reimburse your rent for those days and offer an inconvenience reparation of $100. Please have real backup plans to stay elsewhere during this (hypothetical) short time. Again, VERY unlikely, but possible.<br>\n<br>\nNote: We would be thrilled to house a doula or doula-in-training for September/October/November so that they could gain experience help with the birth, postpartum, and at the same time gain some experience in their own field of work. If this applies, we would obviously not ask you to leave and would possibly be open to negotiations on rent as a trade.<br>\n<br>\nPay rent: $1000 for the larger room (includes internet and utilities), and $1000 security deposit in cash upon move-in. For a couple, rent is $1400. $800 for the smaller room (single person only), deposit of $800. You will receive your deposit back when you&apos;ve emptied and cleaned the room by your agreed-upon move-out date. [For longer term tenants, pay rent on time every month.] <br>\n<br>\nIn addition to cleaning up after yourself after using a space, agree to contribute an hour weekly to deep cleaning jobs in the common spaces, without reminders or nagging. <br>\n<br>\nPlease be respectful of us and of the house. We are cultivating a family home and in our family community we&apos;ll share things here, hang out, and communicate frankly about what works and doesn&apos;t work for us.<br>\n<br>\nIn this household we usually go to sleep and wake on the early side. Our lease terms are that we limit noise at all times but particularly between the hours of 10pm and 8am. We appreciate any peace and quiet we can get in what can be a boisterous neighborhood.<br>\n<br>\nFor the long term, the most important thing to us is that we build a cooperative community that will be nourishing for all involved, particularly our baby.<br>\n<br>\nWe are one floor up from ground level, no elevator. The larger room for rent is furnished with a full-sized bed and has closet access. The smaller features a twin bed, no closet. Our shared spaces include a minimally furnished living room which is useful for yoga or meditation, a stocked kitchen (immediate dishwashing policy in effect), and a single bathroom. DIY home improvement projects such as painting walls and floors in the hall/stairway will be in progress this month.<br>\n<br>\nIf you think you could realistically be a good fit for a month or more, please feel free to send along a description of your current situation and longer-term goals with enough details to give us an idea of your lifestyle. If it seems like it could work, we&apos;ll set up a time to show you the room and get you in as soon as possible.<br>\n<br>\n**In the long term, we&apos;ll ideally find another like-minded couple or single parent with a baby/small child to share this space and all the household responsibilities with us. We would be very interested in negotiating a childcare trade situation, watching each others&apos; babies while the others have a date or go to a class, matching each other hour for hour. In the even longer term, it is our dream to have an in-home daycare, either right here or someplace else. Finding another person with child development expertise that would be on board to create that possibility with us would be amazing.

You will not have to do any house chores, I take care of that, but you will clean up after yourself in the kitchen and bathroom, no dishes left in the sink, etc.<br>\nThis would be an ideal environment for someone who is a short-term intern, student, or someone who works a lot and values coming home to a house where they know they can have peace and rest, with no surprises.
