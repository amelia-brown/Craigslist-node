    "description": "DO NOT BUY CONCERT TICKETS ON CRAIGSLIST ALL FAKE<br>\n<br>\nPhoney concert ticket are over Craigslist also for all popular sporting events ...I saw them for giants games ranger too.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHere are some good tips from another Craigslist poster<br>\n<br>\nMOST TICKETS SOLD on CRAIGSLIST ARE ALL FAKE!<br>\n<br>\nBeware . . . there have been several reports of fake tickets, same seats, etc. being sold. The fakes look &quot;amazingly real&quot; in pictures, and they all come with &quot;receipt of purchase&quot;. <br>\n<br>\nDO NOT BUY!<br>\n<br>\nOnly offer paypal or offer to meet seller in THEIR place of work. If they are legit sellers, then they should be OK with that. Ticket brokers don&apos;t sell at &quot;face value&quot; no matter how desperate they are. Stubhub allows for a nice profit right up to show time. Why would someone sell for less?<br>\n<br>\nLook for the following signs:<br>\n1. Tickets are in &quot;really good&quot; sections but not great. Not front row, but 3rd or 4th row.<br>\n2. Posts are written in shorthand, not in a manner that you would do if you were selling the tickets.<br>\n3. Seat numbers, etc. are not included in post, because they have been RESOLD numerous times<br>\n4. Seller always wants to &quot;text or call&quot; you because they don&apos;t have a legit work email address<br>\n5. Seller always want cash.<br>\n<br>\nDON&apos;T GET FOOLED. TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE PRICES ONLY EXIST IN FANTASYLAND!<br>\n<br>\nI CALLED THE POLICE AND THEY DID NOTHING ABOUT IT SO I DECIDED TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE AWARE OF THESE SCUMBAGS!!<br>\nATTACHED ARE PHOTOS OF THE FAKE TICKETS AND ALSO A PHOTO OF SOMEONE WHO RIPPED ANOTHER PERSON OFF FOR $340!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
